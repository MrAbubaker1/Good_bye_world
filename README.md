Still lots to get done

- Possibly remove or change colour of profile pic border?
- some of the forms need to be recentered, as the logo moved left slightly
- individual posts need to be styled a little more, just to make them more appealing
- logo needs to be recentered --> the percent is messing it up, It should stay right in the 
  middle of the posts on the explore page
